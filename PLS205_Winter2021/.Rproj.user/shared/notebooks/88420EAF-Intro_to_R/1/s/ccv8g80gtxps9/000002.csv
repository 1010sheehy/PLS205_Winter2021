# The pound sign/hashtag is very important in R, even though it isn't a function. 
# The '#' denotes that the text following it is a comment. 
# Anything written after a '#' will not be treated as an instruction for R to run. 
# In RStudio, you can see that text after a '#' changes color to indicate it's a comment, and not code. 
# You can use comments to explain in plain English what your code is doing, and why. 
# Your code should have lots of comments.  
# Comments can come after a command on the same line or on their own line. Nothing is returned from this chunk.
