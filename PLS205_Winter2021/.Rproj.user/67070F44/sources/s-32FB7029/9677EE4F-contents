# NEVER EDIT YOUR RAW DATA

# keep a read.me document to keep track of all of the edits you make to subsequent copies of the data

# FORMAT

# row = a single observation
# column = a variable

# avoid keeping multiple datasets in one spreadsheet
# avoid multiple tabs within an excel spreadsheet

# "The only thing worse than null data is no data"
# ^ Effing yes, always indicate if there is simply no value (a line etc) in data sheets

# NEVER use zero for null data
# options: blank, extreme values (-999,999), N/A (not available/applicable), na, NULL, None, No data, Missing, symbols (*, +, -, etc.)

# best is NA or blank, just be sure that column wouldn't include continents (like N.Am.)

# do not use funky excel formatting (colors, notes)
# ^instead, put notes in a final column (will be interpreted as a variable)

# do not record units w/in cells (i.e. 10g), will be read as text

# avoid spaces and symbols in column names, or entries

# HA -- "camel case" --> ex: CamelCase

# put metadata (ie redme files) in same directory

# DATES --> best format is to create a separeate column for day, month, and year

# Keep data in "raw" untouched file and work with a copy

# Use data validation!
