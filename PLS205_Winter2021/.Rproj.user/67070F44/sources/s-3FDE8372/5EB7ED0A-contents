## Question 1

To study the effect of burial time on germination and dormancy of *Hordeum murinum ssp. leporinum* (Hare Barley), 
overwintering seeds were placed in bags in a field, and then removed and tested at six time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 days after burial). The design was a completely randomized design, with 5 replicate bags per burial time.
Each bag contained 200 seeds. At the designed time, each bag was opened, and then the seeds were split evenly between two 
germination trays, and the number of germinating seeds was measured in each tray.


```{r echo = FALSE}
# Ensure the data file is in the same directory as this document
germinant_data = read.csv('~/Desktop/R_Projects/PLS205_Winter2021/PLS205_Winter2021/data/Germination.csv')
str(germinant_data)
```

# For the first set of analyses, treat **Days** as a factor
```{r}
germinant_data$DaysFactor = as.factor(germinant_data$Days)
str(germinant_data)
```

## 2 Use a boxplot to visualize the dose-response curve (ie the number of Germinants observed each Day).
Does there appear to be an effect of age (Date) on number of germinating seeds?

> **Note** For visualization, refer back to the visualization techniques in Lab3 when there were subsamples.
> You should be able to use the same code, just be sure to change all the variable names to match the new dataset
> Be sure to make a new variable called something like `DaysFactor`

```{r}
# grouping subsamples
germinant_means = aggregate(Germinants ~ Bag + DaysFactor , data = germinant_data, FUN = mean)


#inspecting the germination data
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(germinant_means,aes(x=DaysFactor)) + 
    geom_boxplot(aes(y=Germinants,group = DaysFactor),position = position_identity()) + 
    ggtitle('Seed Aging') + expand_limits(y=0)

```

> There does appear to be a response to the number of days seeds were left in bags, with more days in bags leading to less germination.

## 3 Assess whether the linear model assumptions are satisfied by the data.
Treat **Days** as a factor. Use diagnostic plots.

> **Note** Here again, refer to Lab 3 for appropriate diagnostic plots. 
> Again, the same code should work as long as you are careful to change all variable names

```{r}
# germination model
germ_model <- lmer(Germinants ~ DaysFactor + (1|Bag), data = germinant_data)

# diagnostic plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(factor_model,which=c(2,5))
```

> The data fits the Normal Q-Q plot reasonably well, but the residuals at higher and lower quantiles begin to deviate from the line slightly.
> The data appears to have a good spread in the Residuals vs. Factors plot. The slope of the line is relatively flat, and the residuals are evenly spread throughout.

## 4 Test (provide p-values as evidence) if any of extended germination times change germination rate relative to zero days

> **Note** Refer to Lab3 for correct usage of `emmeans()` with `lmer()` models.

```{r}
# examine levels of Days to find control
levels(germinant_data$DaysFactor)

# comparing treatments to the control (Zero days)
library(emmeans)
germ_emmeans <- emmeans(germ_model, trt.vs.ctrl ~ DaysFactor, ref = 1)
summary(germ_emmeans,level = 0.95, infer= c(T,T))$contrast
```

> The 95% confidence intervals do not cross zero for all treatments EXCEPT 30 days. The p-values are especially small for the 90-, 180-, and 360-day treatments.

## 5 Use an ANOVA to assess the evidence for any effect of time germination rate
Is there strong evidence for a difference in germination rate by seed age?

> **Note**. The ANOVA table produced by the `lmer()` function looks a bit different from that of the `lm()` function.
> But all the same information is there, and it should be clear how to interpret
> You should add the argument `ddf = 'Kenward-Roger'` whenever you do `anova()` with a `lmer()` model

```{r}
# conducting ANOVA
anova(germ_model, ddf = 'Kenward-Roger')

# ANOVA using the wrong model (not declaring EU's)
germ_model_wrong <- lm(Germinants ~ DaysFactor + Bag, data = germinant_data)
anova(germ_model_wrong)
```

> The F-value (37.678) is large and the p-value (1.332e-10) is small, so there is evidence that some of the treatments differ.

## 6 Explain the following features of the ANOVA table

1. The Df of the treatment and Experimental Units
2. The ANOVA table doesn't report the MSE, but you can calculate it. Is it the correct number?
     - Hint: try fitting the model incorrectly by forgetting to declare the experimental units. Look at an ANOVA of this model. 
     Can you figure out what the MSE is that's reported by the "correct" ANOVA table? Why is this the wrong MSE? 
     Note: the F-value and p-value of the ANOVA table from the correctly specific model is correct, but the MST and MSE have a different meaning. This is unfortunate, but we'll have to live with it!


> 1. The degrees of freedom (5) is because the experimental units are 6 (6 day-length treatments) and df = EU - 1.
> 2. The MSE for the ANOVA is reported as 23.6 germinants^2, but this is not the correct MSE. This is because  After running an ANOVA for a model where we do not delcare the EUs, the MSE is 72.7 germinants^2.

```{r}
# MSE using germ_model
germ_model_MSE <- 887.95/37.678
germ_model_MSE

# MSE using germ_model_wrong
germ_wrong_MSE <- 5004.6/68.825
germ_wrong_MSE

```




# Question 2

A researcher conducted a study comparing the effect of different ground covers on nitrous oxide fluxes from apple orchard soils. She randomly assigned the inter-row spaces of an orchard block to one of four treatments: 1) no cover (Bare); 2) fescue (Grass); 3) white clover (Legume); and, 4) fescue-clover mix (Mix). Each treatment level was replicated in 6 plots. After rain events, emissions were collected from each plot, analyzed, and the emitted nitrous oxide was calculated in g N~2~O ha^-1^ d^-1^. Average emissions for each plot are reported below.

| Rep |  Bare | Grass | Legume |  Mix  |
|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
|  1  | 44.79 | 21.59 |  20.08 | 21.48 |
|  2  | 53.71 | 21.58 |  16.76 | 24.46 |
|  3  | 68.69 | 25.73 |  15.15 | 25.47 |
|  4  | 70.46 | 32.08 |  17.72 | 27.02 |
|  5  | 88.11 | 27.60 |  15.13 | 18.52 |
|  6  | 95.53 | 22.11 |  19.98 | 21.54 |

```{r echo=FALSE}
NO_data = read.csv('~/Desktop/R_Projects/PLS205_Winter2021/PLS205_Winter2021/data/NO_data.csv')
str(NO_data)
summary(NO_data)
```

## 3 Describe the design of this experiment in detail.

**Design**: Completely randomized design

| Structure | Variable   | Type        | # levels | Experimental Unit |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Treatment | Cover      | Factor      | 4        | Plot              |
| Design    | Rep        | Factor      | 6        |                   |
| Design    | Plot       | Factor      | 24       |                   |
| Design    | Cover:Rep  | Factor      | 24       |                   |
| Response  | Flux       | Numeric     | 24       |                   |

## 4 Test the necessary assumptions of ANOVA. Report on the results.

```{r}
# set up variables as factors

plot_asfactor <- as.factor(NO_data$Plot)
rep_asfactor <- as.factor(NO_data$Rep)
cover_asfactor <- as.factor(NO_data$Cover)

# inspect raw data
ggplot(NO_data, aes(x=cover_asfactor)) + 
    geom_boxplot(aes(y=Flux, group = cover_asfactor),position = position_identity()) + 
    ggtitle('N2O Flux by Cover Crop') + expand_limits(y=0)

# NO flux model
NO_model <- lm(Flux ~ cover_asfactor + rep_asfactor, data = NO_data)

# diagnostic plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(NO_model,which=c(2,5))

# ANOVA
anova(NO_model)
```

> In the normal Q-Q plot, the points seem to deviate from the line at the upper and lower theoretical quantiles, meaning that we may need to perform a transformation to get a better fit. In the residuals vs. factor levels plot, there is good spread amongst the residuals across all planted treatments, but the bare treatment has more spread. This indicates that the bare data deviates from the values oredicted by the models. There is also a slight hump in the data, indicating that the means of the data are slightly higher than expected in the grass treatment level.
> The F-value is big, and the p-value is small, indicating that there is a difference between the means of each treatment.

## 5 Perform an appropriate transformation of the data. Re-check the assumptions of ANOVA, and report the results.

```{r}
# apply angular transformation
NO_data$log_flux <- log(NO_data$Flux)

NO_log_model <- lm(log_flux ~ cover_asfactor + rep_asfactor, data = NO_data)

# diagnostic plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(NO_log_model,which=c(2,5))

# transformed ANOVA
anova(NO_log_model)
```

> A log transform improves the fit in the Q-Q plot and improves the spread in the residuals vs factor levels plots.
> Additionally, the F-value is almost double that in the untransformed ANOVA, and the p-value is even smaller. This lends even stronger evidence that there is a difference between at least one of the treatment means.

## 6 Provide estimates of effects of the various ground covers relative to Bare ground on both the original and transformed data ($\alpha = 0.05$). 
Describe and compare the results of both models. Be sure to provide units for the effect sizes on both scales.

```{r}
# transformed data
log_cover_vs_bare_emmeans = emmeans(NO_log_model, trt.vs.ctrl ~ cover_asfactor, ref = 1)
summary(log_cover_vs_bare_emmeans,level = 0.95,infer = c(T,T))$contrast

exp(-1.01)
exp(-1.36)
exp(-1.09)

# untransformed data
cover_vs_bare_emmeans = emmeans(NO_model, trt.vs.ctrl ~ cover_asfactor, ref = 1)
summary(cover_vs_bare_emmeans,level = 0.95,infer = c(T,T))$contrast

```

> For the UNtransformed data, we find that all three treatments are likely different (p-values < 0.0001) from the mean of the control treatment, bare. The effect size estimates are as follows: Grass emitted 45.1 g N2O per hectare per day (g N~2~O ha^-1^ d^-1^) lESS than bare soil, legumes emitted 52.1 gN2O per hectare per day less than bare, and a mix released 47.1 g N2O per hectare per day less than bare. 
> For the transformed data, we also see that the p-values are similarly small (<0.0001), suggesting that there are differences between the treatments and the control. After log transforming the data, the estimates are reported in the same units, but the distances are off because of the transformation. Without transforming, this table would suggest that grass is only 1.01 g N2O per hectare per day less than bare, legumes are only 1.36 g N2O per hectare per day less than bare, and a mix is 1.09 g N2O per hectare per day less than bare.

## 7 Provide estimates and confidence intervals for the means of the 4 treatments by de-transforming.
**Are the means greater or less than the means estimated on the un-transformed scale?**

```{r}

# detransform
 Grass_Bare_log_est <- exp(-1.01)
Grass_Bare_log_est
 Grass_Bare_log_CIlow <- exp(-1.28)
 Grass_Bare_log_CIlow
 Grass_Bare_log_CIhigh <- exp(-0.729)
 Grass_Bare_log_CIhigh
 Legume_Bare_log_est <- exp(-1.36)
 Legume_Bare_log_est
 Legume_Bare_log_CIlow <- exp(-1.088)
 Legume_Bare_log_CIlow
 Legume_Bare_log_CIhigh <- exp(-0.729)
 Legume_Bare_log_CIhigh
 Mix_Bare_log_est <- exp(-1.09)
 Mix_Bare_log_est
 Mix_Bare_log_CIlow <- exp(-1.36)
 Mix_Bare_log_CIlow
 Mix_Bare_log_CIhigh <- exp(-0.810)
 Mix_Bare_log_CIhigh

```

> For the transformed data, the results need to be de-transformed in order to be directly compared to the UNtransformed data. However, we also see that the p-values are equally small (<0.0001), similarly suggesting that there are differences between the treatments and the control. Without transforming, the estimates are that Grass produces 36% less N2O per h per day than bare, legumes produce 26% less N2O per h per day than bare, and a mix produces 34% less N2O per h per day than bare.
